# Crumpet - A Deliciously Simple Framework
Crumpet is a deliciously simple SASS/SCSS responsive framework that keeps your HTML clean & stays out of your way.

**Tidy HTML** - Crumpet makes use of placeholder selectors to reduce the size of your HTML markup.

**Create Fast** - Create website layouts fast & responsive.

**Freedom** - Crumpet allows you the freedom to do what you want with your code.

## Why?

I hate messy HTML markup, so I wanted to take advantage of the placeholder selectors that's built into SASS to stop all that mess and keep it the the CSS.

I wanted to let people have the freedom to do what they want with their code, so this framework is easy and simple to hack about and make your own.

## What's in the ingredients?

Everything is very straight forward, all the instructions are in the code give to you guidance on how to use Crumpet.

* A `index.html` that gives you a little demo.
* A `settings.scss` file which has the frameworks settings in.
* A `main.scss` which has some demo styles, as well as some instruction on how to incorporate the grid into your site.

## Browser Support

Crumpet can quite easily support pretty much any browser you want with the right files, but I decided I'd leave it to you guys to add the ones that you find work for you (I know we all have our favourites).

## Notes

*Why the name 'Crumpet'?* - Why not? I'm British, it's allowed.
